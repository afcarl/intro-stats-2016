## Introduction to Probabilities

Using the same environment that you created last week, let's install more
pakcapackages, namely emperor, h5py, qiime_default_reference and biom.

```bash
source activate stats
conda install -c conda-forge emperor h5py

pip install qiime_default_reference biom
```

Now we can start working through the distance metrics notebooks.
